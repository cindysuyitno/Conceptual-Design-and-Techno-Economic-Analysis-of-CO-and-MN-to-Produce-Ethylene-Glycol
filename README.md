# Conceptual-Design-and-Techno-Economic-Analysis-of-CO-and-MN-to-Produce-Ethylene-Glycol

## Overview
This is the final project of my team at the last semester of our Chemical Engineering study. The purpose of this project is to generate factory plan for producing Mono Ethylene Glycol, which is widely used in various industries. We propose 2 plant designs, using recycled and unrecycled reactants, then compare the economic values based on profit generated and energy used. The production process itself is also studied deeper, where CO and MN reactants (coal-based reactants that are cheaper than petroleum-based) are used with Pd/Al2O3 and Cu/SiO2 catalysts. The products resulted are anual 6,800 ton Ethylene Glycol with 99% mass purity, of which we considered as good. Best economic values calculated was 0.0894 interest rate and 4 years of payout time.
